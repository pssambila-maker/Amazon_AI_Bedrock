    "# Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Policy - Getting Started Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Policy hands-on demo! This notebook will guide you through the complete workflow of setting up and testing policy-based deterministic controls for AI agent-tool interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is AgentCore Policy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Policy enables developers to define and enforce security controls for AI agent interactions with tools by creating a protective boundary (\"safety box\") around agent operations. AI agents can dynamically adapt to solve complex problems, but this flexibility introduces security challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Leakage**: Agents may inadvertently expose private information\n",
    "- **Business Rule Violations**: Agents might misinterpret or bypass business rules\n",
    "- **Authority Overreach**: Agents could act outside their intended scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy intercepts inbound agent traffic through AgentCore Gateways and evaluates each request against defined policies before allowing tool access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Declarative Security**: Define policies using Cedar language, not code  \n",
    "✅ **Runtime Enforcement**: Policies are evaluated in real-time  \n",
    "✅ **Fine-Grained Control**: From coarse restrictions to detailed access control/ authroization\n",
    "✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Security logic lives outside agent code  \n",
    "✅ **Enterprise Scale**: Deploy autonomous agents safely in production  \n",
