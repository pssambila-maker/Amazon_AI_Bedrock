    "## How Episodic Memory Helps This Healthcare Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "The **EpisodicStrategy** captures interactions as structured episodes and generates meaningful insights across sessions. This goes beyond recording \"what happened\" to understand \"why\" and \"how\" interactions unfolded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three-Step Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extraction** – Identifies useful insights from short-term memory (events) and places them into long-term memory as structured episodes\n",
    "2. **Consolidation** – Determines whether to write information to a new episode or update an existing one\n",
    "3. **Reflection** – Generates insights across multiple episodes to identify patterns and improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Episode Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each episode captures:\n",
    "- **Situation**: What the healthcare professional was trying to accomplish\n",
    "- **Intent**: The primary goal of the interaction\n",
    "- **Assessment**: Whether the goal was successfully achieved\n",
    "- **Justification**: Why the assessment was made\n",
    "- **Turn-by-turn analysis**: Detailed breakdown showing agent routing, tool usage, and decision-making\n",
    "- **Episode-level reflection**: Insights about what worked well in this specific session\n",
    "\n",
    "### Patient-Level Reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflections consolidate across multiple episodes to extract broader insights:\n",
    "- **Successful strategies**: Patterns that consistently work (e.g., routing protocol, data presentation)\n",
    "- **Common use cases**: Types of inquiries frequently made for this patient\n",
    "- **Potential improvements**: Areas where the assistant could be more effective\n",
    "- **Lessons learned**: Insights that span multiple interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits for Healthcare Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improved routing**: Learn which agent handles which types of questions most effectively\n",
    "2. **Better data presentation**: Understand how to format complex healthcare data for quick comprehension\n",
    "3. **Pattern recognition**: Identify common inquiry patterns for specific patients\n",
    "4. **Quality improvement**: Track what works and what doesn't across multiple sessions\n",
    "5. **Contextual awareness**: Future interactions benefit from lessons learned in past sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you'll see how episodes capture the complete flow of multi-agent interactions, and how reflections provide actionable insights for improving the healthcare assistant over time.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Scenario Context\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create a **Healthcare Assistant System** with:\n",
    "1. A **Supervisor Agent** that routes patient questions\n",
    "2. A **Claims Agent** for insurance and billing\n",
    "3. A **Demographics Agent** for patient information\n",
    "4. A **Medication Agent** for prescriptions\n",

    "   - Critical for healthcare workflows that require concurrent processing\n",

    "- Preservation of the main supervisor conversation thread\n",
    "- Compliance with healthcare data separation requirements\n",
    "- Clear audit trails for different types of patient interactions\n",

    "### What We Built:\n",
    "1. **Supervisor Agent** - Orchestrates on main branch\n",
    "2. **Claims Agent** - Handles insurance on claims_agent branch\n",
    "3. **Demographics Agent** - Manages patient info on demographics_agent branch\n",
    "4. **Medication Agent** - Handles medications on medication_agent branch\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Architecture:\n",
    "- **Short-term**: Each agent has isolated branch\n",
    "- **Episodes**: Stored per session `healthcare/{actorId}/{sessionId}`\n",
    "- **Reflections**: Shared across all sessions `healthcare/{actorId}`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits:\n",
    "- ✅ Agents don't interfere with each other's conversations\n",
    "- ✅ All agents contribute to same session's long-term memory\n",
    "- ✅ Learned patterns (reflections) shared across all patient sessions\n",
