    "explanation": "The tool-call uses the web_search function with a single parameter 'query' set to 'Bali Fiji Thailand Seychelles vs Maldives cost comparison honeymoon budget'. While the user asked for Maldives alternatives, they did NOT specifically mention Bali, Fiji, Thailand, or Seychelles by name. The previous search result mentioned Zanzibar and Bora Bora, but not these four destinations. The agent appears to have independently selected these four specific destinations without any basis in the user's statements or prior API results. The specific destination names were not mentioned in the preceding context, making them fabricated additions to the query parameter."

    "explanation": "The query includes 'Phuket Koh Samui' which are specific Thai locations that the user never mentioned. While these are reasonable destinations to research for Thailand honeymoons, they represent specific choices made by the AI rather than information from the user or prior results. The prior search results mentioned Thailand generally but didn't specify Phuket or Koh Samui. This constitutes a minor fabrication of specific location parameters."
