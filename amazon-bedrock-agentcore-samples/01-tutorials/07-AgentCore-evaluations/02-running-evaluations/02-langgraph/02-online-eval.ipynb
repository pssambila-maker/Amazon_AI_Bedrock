    "### Online evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Online evaluation enables live-traffic quality monitoring of deployed agents. Unlike on-demand evaluation which analyzes specific selected interactions, online evaluation continuously evaluates your agent's performance in production environments based on real-time traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Online evaluation consists of three main components. First, **session sampling and filtering** allows you to configure specific rules to evaluate agent interactions. You can set percentage-based sampling to evaluate a portion of all sessions (for example, 10%) or define conditional filters for more targeted evaluation. Second, you can choose from **multiple evaluation methods** including creating new custom evaluators, using existing custom evaluators, or selecting from built-in evaluators. Finally, the **monitoring and analysis** capabilities let you view aggregated scores in dashboards, track quality trends over time, investigate low-scoring sessions, and analyze complete interaction flows from input to output.\n",
    "\n",
    "With online evaluation, you configure the system to automatically monitor specific data sources—either CloudWatch log groups containing agent traces or AgentCore Runtime endpoints. The service continuously processes incoming traces based on your sampling and filtering rules, applies your chosen evaluators in real-time, and outputs detailed results to CloudWatch for analysis. This evaluation type is particularly useful for production monitoring, catching quality regressions early, identifying patterns in user interactions, and maintaining consistent agent performance at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you create and enable an online evaluation configuration, the service runs continuously in the background, evaluating sessions as they occur and providing ongoing visibility into your agent's quality metrics. You can pause, modify, or delete configurations at any time to adapt your evaluation strategy as your needs evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating traces on AgentCore Observability from an agent\n",
    "\n",
    "AgentCore Observability provides comprehensive visibility into agent behavior during invocations by leveraging [OpenTelemetry (OTEL)](https://opentelemetry.io/) traces as the foundation for capturing and structuring detailed execution data. AgentCore relies on [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT)](https://aws-otel.github.io/) to instrument different types of OTEL traces across various agent frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "When your agent is hosted on AgentCore Runtime (like our agent in this tutorial), the AgentCore Observability instrumentation is automatic, with minimal configuration. All you need to do is include `aws-opentelemetry-distro` in `requirements.txt` and AgentCore Runtime handles OTEL configuration automatically. When your agent is not running in AgentCore Runtime, you will need to instrument it with ADOT to have it available in AgentCore Observability. You need to configure environment variables to direct telemetry data to CloudWatch and run your agent with OpenTelemetry instrumentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process looks as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![session_traces](../../images/observability_traces.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your session traces are available in AgentCore Observability, you can use AgentCore Evaluations to evaluate your agent's behavior. For online evaluations, you don't need to do anything extra. Just monitor your agent's performance from the live dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How online evaluation works with the traces\n",
    "\n",
    "On the online evaluation, your agent is invoked and generates traces in AgentCore Observability. Those traces are mapped to sessions and their logs are made available in Amazon CloudWatch Log groups. With the online evaluation, a developer creates an online evaluation configuration for a certain agent and defines a sample rate and the evaluators to be applied for this configuration. AgentCore Evaluations will then automatically evaluate the agent in production, analyzing the produced traces according to the set sampling rate. The developer can then use the AgentCore Observability dashboards to visualize the traces and evaluation scores from the agent to continuously update the agent according to the evaluations results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![session_traces](../../images/online_evaluations.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieving information from previous tutorials\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will use the LangGraph agent deployed in AgentCore Runtime during our prerequisites tutorial. We will evaluate it with pre-built metrics and with the `response_quality` metric we created in the `01-creating-custom-metrics` tutorial. Let's retrieve our agent and evaluator informations."
