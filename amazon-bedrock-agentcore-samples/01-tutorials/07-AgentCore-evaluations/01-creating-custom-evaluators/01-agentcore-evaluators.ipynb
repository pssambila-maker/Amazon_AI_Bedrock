    "## Evaluators Types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in evaluators\n",
    "\n",
    "AgentCore provides 13 pre-configured evaluators that use Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges to assess agent performance. These evaluators come with their carefully crafted prompt templates and pre-selected evaluator models, standardizing the evaluation criteria across different use cases. They are ready to use and you don't need to add any additional configuration to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "These evaluators are divided into 4 different groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Response quality**: evaluators that help you deciding if your agent is working as expected at each turn. They work on a trace-basis and evaluate each user-agent interaction.\n",
    "- **Task completion**: this category has one evaluator (Goal success) that will evaluate the session as a whole. In a multi-turn conversation, this evaluator helps you deciding if the user goal (or goals) were completed and if the final outcome was achieved. In situations where the agent asks follow up questions, this evaluator is essential to understand if the tasks requested were actually completed.\n",
    "- **Tool level**: evaluators that help you understand how sucessful your tool calling is. It measures the accuracy of the tool and parameter selection for the agent at a tool level. If an agent is calling two or more different tools in a single turn, each one of them will have its own metric in the trace.\n",
    "- **Safety**: evaluators that detect if your agent is being harmful or is making steriotyping generalizations about individuals or groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using built-in metrics everything is handled for you from prompt to model. That means that your evaluator cannot be modified, in order to maintain the evaluation consistent and reliable across all users. You can however create your own metrics using a built-in metric as basis. To do so, we provide you with the **Prompt Templates** for our built-in evaluators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom evaluators\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom evaluators provide maximum flexibility by allowing you to define every aspect of your evaluation process while leveraging LLMs as underlying judges. You can customize the following in your custom evaluator:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluator model**: Choose the LLM that best fits your evaluation needs\n",
    "- **Evaluation prompts**: Craft evaluation instructions specific to your use case\n",
    "- **Scoring schema**: Design scoring systems that align with your organization's metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating traces on AgentCore Observability from an agent\n",
    "\n",
    "AgentCore Observability provides comprehensive visibility into agent behavior during invocations by leveraging [OpenTelemetry (OTEL)](https://opentelemetry.io/) traces as the foundation for capturing and structuring detailed execution data. AgentCore relies on [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT)](https://aws-otel.github.io/) to instrument different types of OTEL traces across various agent frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "When your agent is hosted on AgentCore Runtime (like our agent in this tutorial), the AgentCore Observability instrumentation is automatic, with minimal configuration. All you need to do is include `aws-opentelemetry-distro` in `requirements.txt` and AgentCore Runtime handles OTEL configuration automatically. When your agent is not running in AgentCore Runtime, you will need to instrument it with ADOT to have it available in AgentCore Observability. You need to configure environment variables to direct telemetry data to CloudWatch and run your agent with OpenTelemetry instrumentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process looks as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![session_traces](../images/observability_traces.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your session traces are available in AgentCore Observability, you can use AgentCore Evaluations to evaluate your agent's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation levels\n",
    "AgentCore Evaluations operate in different levels of the agent interaction. You can analyse the back and forward conversation as a whole using the session information. You can also evaluate the agent's response to a user question in an individual turn of the conversation using the trace information. Or you can evaluate information inside of a turn, which includes the tool calling and parameter selection, using the span data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create custom metrics for the different levels. The built-in metrics operate in the following scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "![metrics level](../images/metrics_per_level.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will create a metric at trace level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial you will have learned about the AgentCore Evaluation built-in and custom metrics. You will also have created a custom metric to measure the response quality of your agents. \n"
