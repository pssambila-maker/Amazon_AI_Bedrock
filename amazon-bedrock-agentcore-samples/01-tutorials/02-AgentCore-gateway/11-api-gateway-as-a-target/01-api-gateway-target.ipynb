                "As organizations explore the possibilities of agentic applications, they continue to navigate challenges of using enterprise data as context in invocation requests to large language models (LLMs) in a manner that is secure and aligned with enterprise policies. To help standardize and secure those interactions, many organizations are using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification, which defines how agentic applications can securely connect to data sources and tools.\n",
                "\n",
                "While MCP has been advantageous for net new use cases, organizations also navigate challenges with bringing their existing API estate into the agentic era. MCP can certainly wrap existing APIs, but it requires additional work, translating requests from MCP to RESTful APIs, making sure security is maintained through the entire request flow, and applying the standard observability required for production deployments.\n",

                "[Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway.html) now supports [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) as a target, translating MCP requests to AgentCore Gateway (ACGW) into RESTful requests to API Gateway (APIGW). You can now expose both new and existing API endpoints from APIGW to agentic applications via MCP, with built-in security and observability. This notebook covers this new capability and shows how to implement them.\n",

REST API owners can add their API as an ACGW target with a few console clicks or a single CLI command, thus exposing their existing REST API methods as MCP tools via ACGW. API consumers can then connect AI agents with these REST APIs through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and power their workflows with AI integration. Your agentic applications can now connect to your new or existing APIGW API. Today, this integration between ACGW and APIGW supports IAM authorization and API key authorization.\n",
