    "# Use Authorization code grant type outbound oAuth flow for AgentCore Gateway Targets\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Outbound authentication/authorization lets Amazon Bedrock AgentCore gateways securely access gateway targets on behalf of users that were authenticated and authorized during inbound authorization. AgentCore Gateway supports multiple types of outbound authorization such as No authorization, IAM-based outbound authorization, OAuth and API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the following types of OAuth authorization grants:\n",
    "* **Client credentials grant** – Machine-to-machine authentication (also known as 2-legged OAuth). The client application access resources on the application's behalf, rather than on behalf of the user.\n",
    "* **Authorization code grant (New)** – User-delegated access (also known as 3-legged OAuth). The user provides consent for the client application to access resources on behalf of the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "With **version 2025-11-25** of Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification, MCP supports [URL Mode Elicitation](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-11-25-first-mcp-anniversary/#url-mode-elicitation-secure-out-of-band-interactions). URL mode elicitation lets you send users to a proper OAuth flow (or any credential acquisition flow, for that matter) in their browser, where they can authenticate securely without your client ever seeing the entered credentials. The credentials are then directly managed by the server and the client only needs to worry about its own authorization flow to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "AgentCore gateway now supports **Authorization code grant** as Outbound Auth for gateways created with 2025-11-25 as supported MCP version. Authorization code grant is useful when accessing tools on behalf of a user such as Google (email, calendar etc.), Github (repositories, pull requests etc.), Linkedin (user profile, posts etc.) OR internal tools. Authorization code grant flow prioritizes user privacy by not exposing user credentials to third-party applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will create an AgentCore Gateway with Linkedin tools as the target using Authorization code grant. The resulting AgentCore gateway can then be used to build agents that can automate actions Linkedin actions such as getting user info, reading/summarizing posts or even creating new posts etc. on user's behalf.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing the right authentication/authorization pattern\n",
    "When designing your agent authentication/authorization strategy, consider these factors to determine which pattern is most appropriate:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Factor** | **OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant (User-delegated access)** | **OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant (Machine-to-machine authentication)** |\n",
    "|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Data ownership** | User-specific data (emails, documents, personal calendars) | System or organization-owned data (analytics, logs, shared resources) |\n",
    "| **User interaction** | User is present and can provide consent | No user interaction required or available |\n",
    "| **Operation timing** | Interactive, real-time operations | Background, scheduled, or batch operations |\n",
    "| **Permission scope** | Permissions vary by user and their consent choices | Consistent permissions defined at the agent level |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key characteristics of authorization code grant\n",
    "\n",
    "* Requires explicit user consent through an authorization prompt\n",
    "* Provides access to user-specific data and resources\n",
    "* Maintains clear separation between agent identity and user authorization\n",
    "* Supports fine-grained scopes that limit what data the agent can access\n",

    "## OAuth2 Authorization URL Session Binding Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the gateway has been created, let us understand the session binding process before moving any further.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OAuth2 authorization URL session binding process is a critical security mechanism that ensures OAuth2 authorization sessions are properly associated with authenticated users in AgentCore Identity. This process prevents session hijacking and ensures that OAuth tokens are only granted to the intended user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ref : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/oauth2-authorization-url-session-binding.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### How session binding works\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/identity-session-binding.png\" width=\"90%\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Invoke agent – Your agent code or mcp client invokes GetResourceOauth2Token API to retrieve an authorization URL, when an originating agent user wants to access some application or resource that he/she owns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generate authorization URL – AgentCore Identity generates an authorization URL and session URI for the user to navigate to and consent access.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Authorize and obtain access token – The user navigates to the authorization URL and grants consent for your agent to access his/her resource. After that, AgentCore Identity redirects the user's browser to your HTTPS application endpoint with information containing the originating user of the authorization request. At this point, your HTTPS application endpoint determines if the originating agent user is still the same as the currently logged in user of your application. If they match, your application endpoint invokes CompleteResourceTokenAuth so that AgentCore Identity can fetch and store the access token.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Re-invoke agent to obtain access token – Once the application returns a valid response, your agent application will be able to retrieve the OAuth2.0 access tokens that were originally requested for the user. If the users do not match, your application simply does nothing or logs the attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "By allowing your application endpoint to verify the user identity, AgentCore Identity allows your agent application to ensure that it is always the same user who initiated the authorization request and the one who consented access.\n",

    "### Environment-Aware OAuth2 Callback Server\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses an environment-aware `oauth2_callback_server.py` that automatically adapts to different execution environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Local Development:**\n",
    "- **External Callback URL**: `http://localhost:9090/oauth2/callback` (browser-accessible)\n",
    "- **Internal Communication**: `http://localhost:9090` (notebook ↔ server)\n",
    "- **Server Binding**: `127.0.0.1` (localhost only, secure)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **SageMaker Workshop Studio:**\n",
    "- **External Callback URL**: `https://<domain>.studio.<region>.sagemaker.aws/proxy/9090/oauth2/callback` (browser-accessible via proxy)\n",
    "- **Internal Communication**: `http://localhost:9090` (notebook ↔ server in same container)\n",
    "- **Server Binding**: `0.0.0.0` (allows SageMaker proxy to reach server)\n",
    "\n",
    "The OAuth2 callback server automatically detects the environment by checking for `/opt/ml/metadata/resource-metadata.json` and configures itself accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features of oauth2_callback_server.py\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Runs a Local FastAPI Server** (port 9090)\n",
    "   - Provides `/ping` endpoint for health checks\n",
    "   - Provides `/userIdentifier/token` endpoint to store user tokens\n",
    "   - Provides `/oauth2/callback` endpoint to handle OAuth redirects\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Manages User Token Storage**\n",
    "   - Stores the user's JWT token from Cognito authentication\n",
    "   - Associates OAuth sessions with the correct user identity\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handles OAuth Callback Processing**\n",
    "   - Receives OAuth redirects with `session_id` parameter\n",
    "   - Calls `CompleteResourceTokenAuth` to bind the session\n",
    "   - Validates user identity before completing the flow\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Provides Session Security**\n",
    "   - Ensures OAuth sessions are bound to authenticated users\n",
    "   - Prevents unauthorized access to OAuth tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Environment Detection**\n",
    "   - Automatically detects local vs SageMaker Studio environment\n",
    "   - Configures URLs and server binding appropriately\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The OAuth2 session binding process includes several security measures:\n",
    "- **URL Validation**: Only pre-registered callback URLs are allowed\n",
    "- **Session Verification**: User sessions must be validated before token completion\n",
    "- **User Identity Binding**: OAuth sessions are explicitly bound to authenticated users\n",
    "- **Token Isolation**: Each user's OAuth tokens are isolated and secure\n",
    "- **Environment-Aware URLs**: Automatically uses appropriate URLs for each environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive approach ensures that OAuth2 flows are secure and properly attributed to the correct users in multi-user environments, whether running locally or in SageMaker Workshop Studio.\n",
